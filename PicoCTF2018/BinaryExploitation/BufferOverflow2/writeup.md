Alright, this time you'll need to control some arguments.
Can you get the flag from this [program](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/8ec59d858594f0e03108cf12e6177682/vuln)?
You can find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-2_2_46efeb3c5734b3787811f1d377efbefa on the shell server.

Writeup:

This challenge is quite similar to `Buffer Overflow 1` with some additional challenge to it.\
(I recommend reading [`Buffer Overflow 1 Writeup`](https://github.com/Sanduuz/CTFWriteUps/PicoCTF2018/BinaryExploitation/BufferOverflow1/writeup.md) first)

We are given a 32-bit binary and the source code for it. To gain a better understanding of the program's control flow, I open the source code in a new window and run the binary while simultaneously reading the code.
